        <ul>
          <li>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML): made up of elements which work together to provide content and the basic framework for all pages on the web.</li>
          <li>The <span id="tag">head</span> element contains information, or metadata, that helps the browser to render the page correctly. Elements included within the <span>head</span> are not visible when a user looks at a webpage.</li>
          <li>The <span id="tag">body</span> element contains the content that is shown to the user. All the elements that we want the user to see and interact with must be placed inside this element.</li>
          <li>Semantic HTML elements: their names describe their content and the role they play on a webpage.</li>
          <li>BEST PRACTICE: Use semantic elements whenever possible, especially when the content is visible to users.</li>
          <li>Within the body elements, The <span id="tag">header</span> appears at the top of the page and usually contains a navigation menu and/or introductory content.</li>
          <li>The <span id="tag">main</span> element appears in the middle of the page and specifies the main content of a document that is unique to the document.</li>
          <li>The <span id="tag">footer</span> appears at the bottom of the page and usually contains the author, copyright, contact, sitemap, and navigation.</li>
          <li>The <span id="tag">section</span> elements are semantic elements that define a section in a document that contains thematic content. </li>

          <li><span id="tag">git commit -m</span>: creates a commit that captures a snapshot of the currently staged changes.</li>
          <li><span id="tag">git pull origin main</span>: ensures that we have the latest version of the project on our local computer before starting to work.</li>
          <li><span id="tag">git push origin feature/starter-code</span>: pushes the changes we have locally to our remote GitHub branch.</li>
          <li>Then, on the GitHub repo: select the feature branch -> give the pull request (PR) a descriptive title -> designate the base branch as main and the comparison branch as feature/starter-code -> Select the "Create Pull Request" button -> request that one or two other team members review the code before it is merged into the base branch.</li>

          <li><span id="defn">Control flow</span> is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>We can use conditional statements and loops to control the order in which code is executed, or if it is even executed at all.</li>
          <li><span id="defn">Conditionals</span> are code structures used to test if an expression returns true or not. A very common form of conditionals is the if...else statement.</li>
          <li>A <span id="tag">for</span> <span id="defn">loop</span> uses the pattern of indices to run a task on all the items in an array by letting a code block to be executed over and over.</li>
          <li>A <span id="defn">function</span> is different from a for loop or conditional statement because functions must be called by name in order to be executed.</li>
          <li><span id="defn">Calling</span> a function to be executed means controlling where in the control flow a task is executed or if at all.</li>
