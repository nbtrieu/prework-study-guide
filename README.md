# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This webpage was built to store and display notes I took from the lesson 3 modules regarding HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript. My motivation was not only to have this as my study guide but also to practice the skills I learned writing code in HTML, CSS and JavaScript as well as writing Git commands in the terminal.

## Usage

To use this Prework Study Guide, you can review the bullet points in each section box for HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript. If you are unsure which topic to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either at the bottom or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of all the topics along with a suggested topic to study first.
